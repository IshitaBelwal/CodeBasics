Hello, it's me, steadily sharing my practice as I progress on my path toward becoming a data scientist. I aim to maintain consistency in this course.

This repository contains the practice that I did while following the course " Data Science Full Course For Beginners | Python Data Science Tutorial | Data Science With Python" By [codebasics](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3us_ELKYSj_Fth2tIEkdKXvV&si=ln_Jj2DFnnqif-UB)
